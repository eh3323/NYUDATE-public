# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** August 17, 2025

> **Important Non‑Affiliation Notice.** NYUdate is an independent project and is **not** affiliated with NYU or any educational institution.

## 1. Who We Are (Controller)

**Controller:** Operator of **nyudate.com** (individual developer). Contact: **[admin@nyudate.com](mailto:admin@nyudate.com)**. We act as the data controller for personal information processed through the Service (outside the EU/UK, which we do not serve).

## 2. What We Collect

### 2.1 You Provide

* **Contact:** Email (for confirmations, appeals, support). Not public.
* **Evaluation Content:** Names (initials/pseudonyms by default), descriptions of dating experiences, tags, optional custom tags.
* **Evidence:** Images, documents, videos; your descriptions of relevance.
* **Appeals:** Explanations, evidence, and—where applicable—identity verification documents (see §7.3).

### 2.2 Collected Automatically

* **Technical:** IP address, device, OS, browser, pages visited, timestamps.
* **Security:** CAPTCHA/Turnstile, rate‑limit data, file‑scan results.

### 2.3 From Service Providers

* **AI Moderation:** We currently submit **text content** of submissions (which may include personal information) to third‑party moderation services for safety review. We do **not** share uploaded media with such services unless this Policy is updated to say otherwise.
* **Email Delivery/Hosting:** Minimal data necessary to send emails and host the Service.

## 3. How We Use Information

* **Operate the Service:** Review/moderate content; generate privacy‑protected versions of evidence; display approved content; enable search consistent with the Name & Identifiers Policy.
* **Communicate:** Confirmations, status updates, appeals, and important notices.
* **Security/Legal:** Prevent spam/abuse; protect the Service; comply with law and enforce Terms.

## 4. Public vs. Private

**Public:** Approved evaluation text; tags; timestamps; interaction counts; images/videos after redaction/blur. **Full names are displayed only via Exact‑Match Name Search (EMS)** when a user enters an exact name; names are **not** shown in homepage/browse features. We do **not** provide autocomplete, suggestions, fuzzy, phonetic, or partial‑match discovery for names.

**Private:** Email addresses; original unprocessed files; pending/rejected content; admin notes; verification documents; technical/security logs; and search telemetry used for abuse prevention.

## 5. Privacy by Design & Security

* We apply privacy filters to media (face redaction/blur; OCR‑based masking of sensitive text like names, emails, phone numbers, addresses) before public display.
* We remove or minimize metadata (e.g., EXIF) where feasible.
* Original files reside in restricted, encrypted storage; access is logged and limited to authorized personnel.
* We maintain customary safeguards and monitor for abuse. **We may log limited EMS telemetry** (e.g., hashed queries, timestamps, IP prefix) to enforce rate limits and detect abuse. No system is 100% secure.
