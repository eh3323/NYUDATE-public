**Last Updated:** August 17, 2025

> **Important Non‑Affiliation Notice.** NYUdate is an independent project and is **not** affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by New York University (NYU) or any other institution. 

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using this dating evaluation platform (the “Service”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (the “Terms”). If you do not agree to the Terms, do not use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

The Service allows users to submit and view evaluations about dating experiences with others. Features include: (i) submission of reviews; (ii) upload of supporting evidence (images, documents, videos); (iii) public viewing of approved evaluations; (iv) search; and (v) appeal/takedown mechanisms.

## 3. User Responsibilities

### 3.1 Eligibility

* You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service.
* You must provide accurate and truthful information.
* You are responsible for safeguarding your account/email and for activity under it.

### 3.2 Prohibited Conduct 

You agree **NOT** to:

* Submit false, misleading, defamatory, or per se defamatory statements (e.g., criminal accusations) presented as fact rather than opinion.
* Upload or solicit **non‑consensual intimate imagery (NCII)**, sexual content of another person, or sexual‑life/health information about another person.
* Doxx or disclose personally identifying information about private individuals beyond what the Service expressly permits (e.g., full legal names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, social handles, workplace/department/class section, schedules, student ID, photos of IDs, license plates).
* Post private communications (texts, DMs, emails, screenshots) without consent if they reveal sensitive personal data or private content.
* Harass, bully, threaten, stalk, or encourage others to do so; engage in retaliation in academic or workplace contexts.
* Upload malicious code, attempt to bypass moderation, or scrape/crawl the Service without written permission.
* Impersonate any person or misrepresent your affiliation.

### 3.3 Content Standards

All submissions must:

* Be grounded in your own personal experience and framed as **opinion** (“In my experience…”, “I felt…”) rather than unverified factual allegations.
* Focus on dating‑related interactions and be respectful.
* Include only relevant, minimal supporting evidence.
* Comply with these Terms and Community Guidelines (if posted separately).

### 3.4 Name & Identifiers Policy

* **Default display (browse/home):** We display only **initials or pseudonyms** for individuals named in evaluations when content appears in homepage, browse, or recommendations.
* **Exact‑Match Name Search ("EMS"):** We allow display of a person’s **full name** **only** on the dedicated search results page when the user’s query **exactly matches** the stored name string after normalization (spacing, case, and common diacritics). **No** autocomplete, suggestions, fuzzy/phonetic, or partial‑match results are provided. EMS includes safeguards: minimum length and two‑token requirement for Latin‑script names, rate‑limiting, anomaly detection, user warning/interstitial, and prominent “opinion, not fact” disclaimers on results.
* **Scope & Prohibitions:** Names may be stored and surfaced via EMS. You must **not** include other unique identifiers (addresses, phone numbers, emails, social handles, NetID, workplace/department/class section, schedules, student ID, photos of IDs, license plates) or any information that facilitates doxxing. Submissions attempting to identify a person **beyond a name** will be removed or redacted.
* **Consent & Public‑Interest:** Consent is **not required** for EMS display of a name, but we may require verifiable consent for certain categories or **decline indexing** where prohibited by law. The Service is unavailable to residents of the EU/UK (§10).
* **Right of Reply & De‑indexing:** Individuals may request a right‑of‑reply (at our discretion) and may use **Priority Takedown** (§6.2) to request removal or **EMS de‑indexing**. EMS may be paused or disabled for any name during review or upon detection of abuse risk.

## 4. Content Submission, Moderation & License

### 4.1 Submission Process

* All content is screened by automated tools and may require revision.
* Final approval is subject to administrative review.
* Most reviews are processed quickly, but **timelines are not guaranteed**.

### 4.2 Content Ownership & License

* You retain ownership of your content.
* You grant us a **non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free, transferable, and sublicensable** license to host, store, reproduce, adapt (for moderation/safety), publish, and display your content as necessary to operate and improve the Service. This license survives termination to the extent needed for legal compliance, archival, and dispute resolution.
* We may remove, edit, restrict, or refuse any content at our discretion.

### 4.3 Evidence & Files (Privacy‑Preserving Processing)

* We strip metadata where feasible and apply face/sensitive‑text redaction and blurring before any public display.
* Original files are stored securely with restricted access and are not publicly accessible or downloadable.
* We may retain files as needed for moderation, safety, and legal purposes.

### 4.4 Copyright / DMCA Notice & Repeat Infringers

* If you believe content infringes your copyright, send a notice to **[admin@nyudate.com](mailto:admin@nyudate.com)** with subject **“DMCA Notice”** including: your contact details; identification of the work; the allegedly infringing material (URL); a good‑faith statement; and a statement under penalty of perjury that you are authorized; and an electronic signature.
* We may remove content upon a valid notice and may terminate repeat infringers.

## 5. Privacy

Your use is also governed by our Privacy Policy. Where these Terms conflict with the Privacy Policy regarding data handling, the Privacy Policy controls.

## 6. Appeals, Notice & Takedown

### 6.2 Priority Takedown for Affected Individuals

* Individuals named in evaluations may request priority review.
* **Identity verification:** Provide a redacted government ID (masking ID number and non‑needed fields) sufficient to match name and photo. Use our secure upload link (not email) when available.
* **Processing target:** We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process complete requests **within 72 hours**; timelines are not guaranteed.
* **Interim measures:** We may restrict access while reviewing. If the request is facially valid (e.g., NCII, safety risk), we may remove content promptly pending final review.
* **Outcomes:** If verified, we may (i) remove content, (ii) **de‑index** the name from EMS, (iii) redact names within the post where feasible, and/or (iv) display a right‑of‑reply.

### 6.3 Evidence Requirements

* Appeal evidence must be relevant and may not expose third‑party sensitive data.
* Links should be access‑limited (no public doxxing) and may be requested via secure upload.
